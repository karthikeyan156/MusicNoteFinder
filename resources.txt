1. Librosa Default
Criteria: High tempo (>120 BPM)
Reason: librosa.onset.onset_detect uses a default spectral flux onset detection algorithm which is robust for a wide range of audio signals, particularly effective for fast-paced music where beats and rhythmic patterns are prominent.

2. Librosa Backtrack
Criteria: High spectral centroid (>3000 Hz)
Reason: Backtracking helps refine the onset times to align with transient peaks, which is particularly useful for high-pitched sounds and instruments where precise onset timing is crucial.

3. Librosa Custom
Criteria: High tempo (>120 BPM) and high spectral centroid (>2500 Hz)
Reason: Custom parameters like pre_max, post_max, delta, and wait can be fine-tuned to better detect onsets in complex, fast-paced, and high-frequency music tracks, providing more accurate results.

4. Aubio HFC
Criteria: Low zero-crossing rate (<0.05)
Reason: High Frequency Content (HFC) is effective for detecting onsets in signals with clear spectral changes, making it suitable for monophonic signals or instruments with clear attack transients.

5. Aubio Complex
Criteria: General case for more complex audio
Reason: The complex domain method is versatile and performs well across a variety of signals, balancing between spectral and phase information for accurate onset detection.

6. Aubio Energy
Criteria: Low zero-crossing rate (<0.05) and low spectral centroid (<1500 Hz)
Reason: Energy-based methods are simple and effective for detecting onsets in monophonic signals with low spectral complexity, such as solo instrumental or vocal tracks.
